# toop-goopra-models

This project contains the Archimate model of the TOOP Reference Architecture (TOOPRA). We are using the [Archi tool](https://www.archimatetool.com/) with the [model repository collaboration plugin](https://www.archimatetool.com/plugins/) for maintaining the TOOPARA Archimate model. You need to have access rights to be able to save changes to the model. If you currently don't have access please contact Sander Fieten.
